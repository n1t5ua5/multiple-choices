Today I input a new dataset inside the questions array but something still isn't working, I can't exit the program in the terminal without closing the terminal itself. There is no prompt available to exit, so I'm going to input one now just to use the program to study over the weekend. In the future I will elaborate more on how this was built & how to make it more useful.

Setting up the beta version tonight so that as I study for certain quizzes & tests, I'll always have an easy way to go over some of the tough questions I face by playing a quick multiple choice game. I'm starting from scratch on this one so first, I created a Journal folder, main.py & README.md file to build, document & share this open-sourch application with anyone. Inside of main, I created a class of Question which returns a question & answer upon being prompted & made my first commit from the terminal.

I'll need to add some JavaScript, HTML & CSS too tomorrow because as of now it only works in the terminal. Then I want to add comments line-by-line for everything already written, include unit testing & a requirements.txt file.

I just wanted to get things up & running today for my own sake. Tomorrow I'll go more in depth on how I wrote the program in detail too.
