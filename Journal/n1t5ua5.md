Setting up the beta version tonight so that as I study for certain quizzes & tests, I'll always have an easy way to go over some of the tough questions I face by playing a quick multiple choice game. I'm starting from scratch on this one so first, I created a Journal folder, main.py & README.md file to build, document & share this open-sourch application with anyone. Inside of main, I created a class of Question which returns a question & answer upon being prompted & made my first commit from the terminal.
