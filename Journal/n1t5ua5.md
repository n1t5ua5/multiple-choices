Setting up the beta version tonight so that as I study for certain quizzes & tests, I'll always have an easy way to go over some of the tough questions I face by playing a quick multiple choice game. I'm starting from scratch on this one so first, I created a Journal folder, main.py & README.md file to build, document & share this open-sourch application with anyone. Inside of main, I created a class of Question which returns a question & answer upon being prompted & made my first commit from the terminal.

I'll need to add some JavaScript, HTML & CSS too tomorrow because as of now it only works in the terminal. Then I want to add comments line-by-line for everything already written, include unit testing & a requirements.txt file.

I just wanted to get things up & running today for my own sake. Tomorrow I'll go more in depth on how I wrote the program in detail too.
